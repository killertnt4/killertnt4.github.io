[THE] TRANSFER OF PRISONERS ACT, 1950
( ACT 29 OF 1950)
[The text of the Act printed here is as on 30-11-1998]
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
“Section 29 of the Prisoners Act, 1900, inter alia provides for the inter-State
transfer of prisoners between the States in Parts A, C and D of the First
Schedule to the constitution. There is no provision, however, either in the
Prisoners Act, 1900, or any other law for the transfer of prisoners from
prisons in those States to prisons in part B States and vice versa. Cases may
arise where the removal or transfer of prisoners from Parts A, C and D States

judge or an additional judge of a Special Court, of the age of superannuation under the rules applicable to
him in the service to which he belongs shall not affect his continuance as such judge or additional judge
and the Central Government may by order direct that he shall continue as judge until a specified date or

constitute such offence or upon a police report of such facts.

exceeding three years or with fine or with both, the Special Court may, notwithstanding anything
contained in sub-section (1) of section 260 or section 262 of the Code, try the offence in a summary way
in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Code and the provisions of sections 263 to 265 of the
Code shall, so far as may be, apply to such trial:
Provided that when, in the course of a summary trial under this sub-section, it appears to the Special

Court shall recall any witnesses who may have been examined and proceed to re-hear the case in the
manner provided by the provisions of the Code for the trial of such offence and the said provisions shall
apply to, and in relation to, a Special Court as they apply to and in relation to a Magistrate:

the Code to such Special Court.

under this Act may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, be held in camera if the Special Court so
desires.

Special Court shall be held on day-to- day basis on all working days and have precedence over the trial of
any other case against the accused in any other court (not being a Special Court) and shall be concluded in
preference to the trial of such other case and accordingly the trial of such other case shall, if necessary,
remain in abeyance.
20. Power to transfer cases to regular courts.—Where, after taking cognizance of any offence, a
Special Court is of the opinion that the offence is not triable by it, it shall, notwithstanding that it has no
jurisdiction to try such offence, transfer the case for the trial of such offence to any court having
jurisdiction under the Code and the Court to which the case is transferred may proceed with the trial of
the offence as if it had taken cognizance of the offence.

not exceeding three years or with fine or with both, the Special Court may, notwithstanding
anything contained in sub-section (1) of section 260 or section 262 of the Code, try the
offence in a summary way in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Code and the
provisions of sections 263 to 265 of the Code shall, so far as may be, apply to such trial:
Provided that when, in the course of a summary trial under this sub-section, it
appears to the Special Court that the nature of the case is such that it is not desirable to try it
in a summary way, the Special Court shall recall any witnesses who may have been
examined and proceed to re-hear the case in the manner provided by the provisions of the
Code for the trial of such offence and the said provisions shall apply to, and in relation to, a
Special Court as they apply to and in relation to a Magistrate: 7
Provided further that in the case of any conviction in a summary trial under this
section, it shall be lawful for a Special Court to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term

Code for the trial before a Court of Session.

sub-section (2) of section 13 shall be dealt with as if such case had been transferred under
section 406 of the Code to such Special Court.
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, but subject to the provisions of section
299 of the Code, a Special Court may, if it thinks fit and for reasons to be recorded by it,
proceed with the trial in the absence of the accused or his pleader and record the evidence
of any witness, subject to the right of the accused to recall the witness for cross-examination.
17. Protection of witnesses.—(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code,
the proceedings under this Act may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, be held in camera
if the Special Court so desires.
(2) On an application made by a witness in any proceeding before it or by the Public
Prosecutor in relation to such witness or on its own motion, if the Special Court is satisfied
that the life of such witness is in danger, it may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, take
such measures as it deems fit for keeping the identity and address of such witness secret.
(3) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of sub-section (2),
the measures which a Special Court may take under that sub-section may include—

respect of anything done or purported to be done in exercise of the powers conferred by this
Act.
19. Trial by Special Court to have precedence.—The trial under this Act of any
offence by a Special Court shall be held on day-to- day basis on all working days and have
precedence over the trial of any other case against the accused in any other court (not being
a Special Court) and shall be concluded in preference to the trial of such other case and
accordingly the trial of such other case shall, if necessary, remain in abeyance.
20. Power to transfer cases to regular courts.—Where, after taking cognizance of
any offence, a Special Court is of the opinion that the offence is not triable by it, it shall,
notwithstanding that it has no jurisdiction to try such offence, transfer the case for the trial of
such offence to any court having jurisdiction under the Code and the Court to which the case
is transferred may proceed with the trial of the offence as if it had taken cognizance of the
offence. 8

sentence or order including an interlocutory order of a Special Court.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (3) of section 378 of the Code, an

Provided further that no appeal shall be entertained after the expiry of period of ninety days.
22. Power of State Government to designate Court of Session as Special
Courts.—(1) The State Government may designate one or more Courts of Session as

Schedule.

modifications, namely—
(i) references to “Central Government” in sections 11 and 15 shall be construed as

with the functions of the Corps, the State Government may, instead of constituting a separate Corps for

directions given by such Director.

such form as may be prescribed.
6. Dismissal of members of Civil Defence Corps.—(1) Where any member of the Corps fails or has
failed, in the opinion of the Controller, to discharge his duties as such member satisfactorily or is or has
been found guilty of any misconduct in the discharge of his duties as such member, the Controller may,
after an inquiry in which such member of the Corps has been given a reasonable opportunity of being
heard in respect of the charges against him, by an order, dismiss such member from the Corps.
(2) Where the Controller is of opinion that the continued presence of any member of the Corps is
undesirable, he may, without assigning any reason, summarily dismiss such member from the Corps.
7. Appeal.—A member of the Corps who is dismissed from the Corps under section 6 may prefer an
appeal to the State Government within thirty days from the date of such dismissal and that Government
may, on such appeal, confirm, modify or reverse the order made by the Controller or other authority.

such functions in relation to the carrying out of measures for civil defence as may be assigned to them by
rules made under this Act or by any other law for the time being in force.

or for discharging such functions in relation to the carrying out of measures for civil defence as may be
specified in such order.
(3) Subject to such orders as the Central Government may make in this behalf, any member of the
Corps of any State may at any time be required, by order, to discharge functions in relation to civil
defence in any other State and shall while discharging such functions, be deemed to be a member of the
Corps of that other State and be vested with the powers, functions and privileges and be subject to the
liabilities of a member of the Corps in that other State.
9. Power to make regulations.—(1) The Central Government may, by notification, make regulations
for carrying out the purposes of this Chapter.
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such regulations
